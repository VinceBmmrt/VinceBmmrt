I'm a developer that loves simplifying things. I love breaking down complex problems into easy solutions. I Currently live in Paris as a software developer. My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve the product.

## 🌱 What I Do

- Currently diving deeper into advanced agentic AI implantation.
- Always eager to stay updated with the latest developments in web technologies.

Explore some projects to get a feel for my skills:
- [Career Digital Twin Alter Ego](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vincentBmmrt/career_conversation): An AI-powered conversational agent built with Gemini, OpenAI SDK, Gradio, and Python.  
  Designed as a digital alter ego to introduce myself to future employers and sends 📱 Pushover notifications when a user shares contact info or asks unknown questions.
  
- [FullStack E-Shop project in React](https://cerulean-melba-c14f75.netlify.app/): A complete e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, Redux, and Stripe.  
  Includes full authentication via OAuth, product browsing, cart management, and secure payment processing — all tested with Jest.

- [4 Agents-AI-Engineering-Team](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/4-Agents-Engineering-Team) 🤖👨‍💻🧪: A collaborative AI-driven software engineering team powered by CrewAI, where four specialized agents — tech lead 🧠, backend dev 🔧, frontend dev 🎨, and QA engineer ✅ — work together to design, build, test, and demo a complete Python project. Fully modular and configurable 🛠️, each agent uses a tailored language model to optimize its task. Includes a Gradio demo interface 💻 and automated unit testing 🔁 for structured, high-quality development. [demo here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ePDdkq0TVcTeYgG-axHndiNdVlBoeM5/view)

- [AI Deep Research](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/AI-DeepResearch-App):  A multi-agent research application powered by OpenAI's API and Gradio.  
  It performs parallel searches (customizable in the code), synthesizes the results into a well-structured markdown report, and sends it via email using Resend.  
  💸 Not deployed online to avoid OpenAI API costs — but you can [watch a full demo here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7ZVjc3eCQ7Z6bjfRF2HYZhjHBgFwspS/view).

- [Crew-AI Debate System](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/Crew-AI-Debate-System) 🧠⚔️: A multi-agent debate simulation powered by CrewAI.  
It features two AI debaters and a judge over a motion.  
You can plug in your own API keys and use any models you like and create a debate between Claude, ChatGPT, and Deepseek, and let the judge pick a winner based on logic and clarity.  
  
- [AI Agentic Calendar Assistant](https://ai-assistant-langraph-openrouter-ew8l.vercel.app/): A personal AI assistant with a simple interface that can access your Google Calendar to smartly add events based on availability, check free time slots, and keep conversation history. The AI is powered by Langraph with an agent using OpenRouter.
