I'm a developer that loves simplifying things. I love breaking down complex problems into easy solutions. I Currently live in Paris as a software developer. My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. I take criticism well, and use suggestions to improve the product.

## 🌱 What I Do

- Currently diving deeper into advanced agentic AI implantation.
- Always eager to stay updated with the latest developments in web technologies.

Explore some projects to get a feel for my skills:
- [Career Digital Twin Alter Ego](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vincentBmmrt/career_conversation): An AI-powered conversational agent built with Gemini, OpenAI SDK, Gradio, and Python.  
  Designed as a digital alter ego to introduce myself to future employers and sends 📱 Pushover notifications when a user shares contact info or asks unknown questions.
  
- [FullStack E-Shop project in React](https://cerulean-melba-c14f75.netlify.app/): A complete e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, Redux, and Stripe.  
  Includes full authentication via OAuth, product browsing, cart management, and secure payment processing, all tested with Jest.

- [4 Agents-AI-Engineering-Team](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/4-Agents-Engineering-Team) 🤖👨‍💻🧪: A collaborative AI-driven software engineering team powered by CrewAI, where four specialized agents: tech lead 🧠, backend dev 🔧, frontend dev 🎨, and QA engineer ✅ — work together to design, build, test, and demo a complete Python project. Fully modular and configurable 🛠️, each agent uses a tailored language model to optimize its task. Includes a Gradio demo interface 💻 and automated unit testing 🔁 for structured, high-quality development. [demo here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ePDdkq0TVcTeYgG-axHndiNdVlBoeM5/view)

- [AI Sidekick Assistant](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/Langraph-AI-Sidekick-Assistant) 🤖🚀: This experimental project showcases a cutting-edge AI assistant capable of organizing knowledge and actions as interconnected graphs. It seamlessly combines web search 🔍, automated browsing 🌐, code execution 🐍, file handling 📂, email writing and reading 📧, and knowledge retrieval from Wikipedia 📚, all while self-evaluating and self-correcting its answers to improve over time.  
If you’re fascinated by AI that can think, act, and adapt autonomously, dive in and explore this experimental journey into intelligent assistants.
We empower the AI to run Python code dynamically, making it incredibly powerful but use this capability with caution to ensure safety. Explore with curiosity and care! ⚠️
Demo video available here: 🎥 [AI Sidekick Assistant Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q4y5yFmMHtf4N3U7WncXWXR6v8bpbm9k/view)

- [Autonomous AI Trading Simulation](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/Autonomous-Trading-Simulation) 📈💹  
  An experimental simulation where multiple AI agents — inspired by iconic investors like Buffett, Soros, Dalio, and Wood — develop and evolve their own trading strategies.  
  Each agent leverages **MCP servers**, real-time **Polygon market data**, **Brave Search**, and persistent memory 🧠 to adapt over time.  
  🔧 Built with **Python 3.12+, Gradio, OpenAI Agents, Plotly, and multi-model orchestration** (GPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok).  
  🎥 [Watch demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wud_t8fTiFNZBx5Hn02OoVFxCJR-yGR/view)

- [Agents Army Factory](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/agents-army-factory-autogencore) 🤖🛠️: An experimental platform for creating autonomous AI agents that can brainstorm, generate Python code, and collaborate in real-time. Features a Creator agent capable of dynamically generating new agents, inter-agent messaging, and customizable objectives. ⚠️ Experimental.  
Demo video available here: 🎥 [View Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QUplfJMUBH3g-4LIjkz3D-XM2dhRPoo9/view)


- [AI Deep Research](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/AI-DeepResearch-App):  A multi-agent research application powered by OpenAI's API and Gradio.  
  It performs parallel searches (customizable in the code), synthesizes the results into a well-structured markdown report, and sends it via email using Resend.  
  💸 Not deployed online to avoid OpenAI API costs — but you can [watch a full demo here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7ZVjc3eCQ7Z6bjfRF2HYZhjHBgFwspS/view).

- [StockPicker AI-powered investment research assistant](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/CrewAI-StockPicker-MultiAgents-System-For-Investements) 📈🤖💸: This system coordinates multiple specialized agents working hierarchically to identify trending companies 🔍, analyze their financials 📊, and produce smart stock recommendations 📝. The final advice is delivered via custom mobile push notifications 📲.
It also features contextual memory layers 🧠 using SQLite and Google Generative AI embeddings for semantic understanding and relevance. Designed for automated financial insights with structured multi-agent reasoning.

- [Crew-AI Debate System](https://github.com/VinceBmmrt/Crew-AI-Debate-System) 🧠⚔️: A multi-agent debate simulation powered by CrewAI.  
It features two AI debaters and a judge over a motion.  
You can plug in your own API keys and use any models you like and create a debate between Claude, ChatGPT, and Deepseek, and let the judge pick a winner based on logic and clarity.  
  
- [AI Agentic Calendar Assistant](https://ai-assistant-langraph-openrouter-ew8l.vercel.app/): A personal AI assistant with a simple interface that can access your Google Calendar to smartly add events based on availability, check free time slots, and keep conversation history. The AI is powered by Langraph with an agent using OpenRouter.

- [Netflix Clone project in Next.js](https://netflix-portfolio-nine.vercel.app/): Featuring Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TMDB API, responsive design, server components, optimized images, and dynamic content fetching

- [GPT App with Spring AI](https://springai-front-33avo5rrd-vincebmmrts-projects.vercel.app/): Full-stack AI chatbot with a Java Spring backend, and simple React frontend.
